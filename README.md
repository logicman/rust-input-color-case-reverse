# rust-input-color-case-reverse
My daughter saw me learning Rust and she gave me this project to do :)

The program will ask for an input and will do the following -
- randomly upper or lower case each char
- randomly color code each char
- reverse the entire string

e.g.
Enter a word --------->>>>>>
the marina promenade
The output is: thE marinA pRomenADe
